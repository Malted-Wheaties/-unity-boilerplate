# unity-boilerplate

Some template scripts that come in useful for almost every game I make with Unity

Note these are not fit for use in production builds as-is. They contain debug info as well as some other issues that need addressing, for example moving screen shake utils out of player movement scripts.

The scripts under the `./forced-perspective` are simply dumps of drafts I have written to attempt to replicate the effect seen in games such as Superliminal. They don't work too reliably in their current state and I hope to revisit them sometime in the future.
